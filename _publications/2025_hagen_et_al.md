excerpt: <blockquote>...our theory proposes that when there were asymmetries in information or computational resources, many of the diverse cognitive adaptations that evolved to benefit the individual could have been deployed as computational services to benefit others in exchange for various payments, thereby helping subsidize the large fixed energetic cost of maintaining the brain. Such services might help explain the emergence of leaders and shamans, key social roles in hunter-gatherer societies.</blockquote>
