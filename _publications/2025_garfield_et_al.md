collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025_garfield_et_al
excerpt: <blockquote>The MCL theory explains why leadership emerges and why it varies among human societies and throughout individual life histories. It proposes that individuals become leaders when they draw on distinct forms of capital to provide benefits or impose costs on group members in ways that help resolve the challenges of group living while also producing net benefits for both followers and themselves.</blockquote>
