excerpt: <blockquote>Here, we provide consistent support for the theory that followersâ€™ perceptions of intergroup conflict drive up preferences for dominant leadership. Across four independent tests based on a large, original dataset containing participants from 25 different countries spread across the globe, we find broad support for this conflict hypothesis.</blockquote>
